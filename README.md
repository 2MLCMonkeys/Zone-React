Welcome to ZONE UNKNOWN, an adventure game based on survival. You find yourself stranded in a solar system due to your warp drive breaking down. Explore 3 planets and find parts to rebuild your warp drive. Along the way, you will encounter harsh events that will test your survival skills. Some you will have to make tough choices to hopefully survive long enough to get back home. You need to manage your HEALTH, OXYGEN and FUEL. You lose 1 OXYGEN per turn and will need 3 FUEL to replenish your O2 at the ship (middle hex). When your HEALTH hits 0, you lose! To advance to the next planet, collect the warp drive piece and return to your ship. Good luck and don't forget to use the chat if you get stuck.

## Description
Zone Unknown is a user interactive game where you're given random events and real choices to make that will affect your journey in unique ways each time you play. Every choice you make and every place you explore on the planet will be your own personal experience. There is a user chat as well to help you along the way. Chat with other players and learn how they have overcome the challenges of the game as their journey progresses from planet to planet, with the difficulty increasing as you travel.

You are presented with a simple back story and gameplay goals. Either you are a new user and can make a new game or a returning user with a saved game with your unique screen name. After chooseing either a new game or continuing a previous game the planet itself comes into view along with a nav bar that allows you to return to the game presentation page or open the user chat. Throughout the entire game you can dynamically open this chat without ever interrupting your game. As you progress through the planets and gain your resources all labeled at the side of your screen in real time counter for every move you make, you will gain pieces of a warp drive on every planet to help you leave the solar system and return back to earth. The last planet you will need to fund the special fuel for your warp drive.  Each planet increases in diffculty as you try to find all of the warp drive pieces. Good luck on your journey!
